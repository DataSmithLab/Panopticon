## Game Overview

Drawing inspiration from Monopoly, Panopticon reimagines financial systems as a data economy where players alternate between being digital service users and developers. In this game, players navigate a game board, claiming digital services by iteratively creating privacy designs, critiquing others' designs, and revising their own based on peer feedback. 

### Core Mechanics

- **Data Points**: Function as currency; developers spend them to enter the market and earn them when users access their services
- **Trust Scores**: Measure privacy design quality; decrease when users identify privacy concerns through critiques
- **Critiques and Inquiries**: Players learn by critiquing and inquiring others' designs and receiving feedback on their own

## Game Materials

This repository contains all materials needed to play Panopticon:

- **Game Board**: [PDF](game_board.pdf) (A3 preferred, or 2 A4 sheets connected)
- **Game Rules**: [PDF](panopticon_rules.pdf) | [Markdown](panopticon_rules.md)
- **Design Worksheet**: [PDF](worksheet.pdf) 
- **Task Bank**: [PDF](task_bank.pdf) | [Markdown](task_bank.md)

File Formats
- PDF Files: Ready for printing without modifications
- Markdown Files: Editable versions if you wish to customize or expand on the materials

## Setup Instructions

1. **Print the Game Board**: Ideally on A3 paper. If unavailable, print on two A4 sheets and put them together.
2. **Print Design Worksheets**: One per player.
3. **Prepare Task Bank**: Print or have digital access to the task scenarios.
4. **Gather Supplies**:
    - Dice (1-2)
    - Player tokens (3-4 game pieces that represent each player as they move around the game board)
    - Whiteboard or papers and pens for each player
    - Timer
5. **Assign a Teacher/Facilitator**: One person should act as the judge who scores critiques.

Before starting, walk players through:
- The game board layout and different types of spaces
- How to use the design worksheet 
- Critique scoring criteria (specificity, justifiability, and actionability)

Hand each player:
- A design worksheet
- Paper for notes
- A game piece
- 1,000 data points


## Facilitation Tips

### For the Teacher/Facilitator
- Familiarize yourself with the scoring criteria for critiques before starting
- Encourage specific, actionable feedback rather than vague criticism
- Keep the game moving at a good pace to maintain engagement
- Allocate appropriate time limits for design creation (2 minutes) and revisions (1 minute)

### For Players
- Focus on collabrative learning rather than winning
- Be constructive in your critiques
- Use the worksheet structure to organize your thoughts
