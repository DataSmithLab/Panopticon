## Description
Panopticon is an educational board game designed to help data science students learn how to design privacy-sensitive data practices. Inspired by Monopoly, it models a data economy where players switch between the roles of digital service users and developers. Players iteratively create, critique, and refine privacy designs, promoting peer learning and formative feedback. The artifact provides all necessary game materials, including the game board, rules, design worksheets, and task bank, enabling researchers and educators to access and use the game.
